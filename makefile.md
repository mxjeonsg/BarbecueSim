## Barbecue Simulator

Who said **leaking memory** wasn't fun?

### How to run? (At the moment works only inside VS Code)
```console
git clone https://github.com/mxjeonsg/BarbecueSim
cd BarbecueSim
code .
dotnet build
dotnet run
## You can avoid runing the last commands by just pressing "F5" inside VS Code
```
In the case you don't have the .NET setup stuff
configured, you'll be instructed to do so.

|> WARNING
Even though it might seem funny. It can make your system crash.
No disc data is directly affected by this programme's execution,
but you'd still wanna proceed with caution.
Each time you execute the programme, you'll be asked on procedure.

### To fix:
* Command line arguments (/d)
* Proper code documentation
* For some stupid reason doesn't run outside VS Code
* Optimise the tacky ahh best score thing
* Maybe save the best score in the registry. (Less likely)
